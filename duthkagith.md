# Duthka'gith
The brutal spawn of the Githyanki and Ephelomon, Tiamat's consort. These hardy fighters are physically and mentally superior to the Gith in every way, and they know it, too.

## Lineage perks
### Child of Ephelomon:
 - You can tap in to the hardiness and intelligence of your dragon ancestors. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may choose either your Intelligence and Constitution stats. The one you select gets a bonus of +1, and you are proficient in ability checks and saving throws in that stat. These proficiencies and bonus last until the end of your next long rest.

### Natural Weapons:
 - You can attack with your claws and bite. Your bite attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 plus one half of your Strength modifier, while your claw attack deals damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier. You are considered proficient with these attacks. Your bite or claw attacks count as unarmed attacks, and take an action point each. You may use a bonus point to make a second claw or bite attack after you make one with an action, which do not benefit from your Strength modifier when calculating damage.
