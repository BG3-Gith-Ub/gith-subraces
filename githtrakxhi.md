## Lineage perks
### Exotoxin
 - Whenever you take a short or long rest, your body absorbs the toxins and pollutants in the air. Any allied creatures resting within 3m of you that regain hit points by expending hit die may regain additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, and are cured of the effects of any poison they are under.

### An Environment So Toxic
 - A number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest, you may use a bonus action to poison a melee weapon or projectile before you attack with it. You may also use a reaction to attempt to poison any creature that grapples you, hits you with an unarmed attack, or touches your skin. 
 - If you are casting a spell that deals poison damage, you may also spend a bonus action to add your own synthesized poison effect to it. Adding your synthesized poison effect in this way consumes two uses of this ability instead of one.

### Pick Your Poison
 - You are immune to being poisoned and poison damage. Whenever you complete a long rest, you may choose an effect from the following list that your synthesized poison may inflict. The DC for these effects is equal to 10 plus your Constitution modifier.
    - Blinded: the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until their next turn.
    - Paralyzed: the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until their next turn.
    - Sleep: the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or fall asleep until their next turn.

### Sommelier
 - You have advantage on perception checks when identifying poisons or toxins, and may also ingest a portion of them to add half your proficiency bonus to the roll.
