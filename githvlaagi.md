# Githvlaagi
When a gith is too stubborn and ambitious to die (looking at you, Vlaakith), they can become a lich-like creature, feigning off death itself in pursuit of their goals.

## Lineage perks
### No Rest for the Wicked:
 - You are immune to being put to sleep or knocked unconscious by an enemy's spell or ability. This does not apply when your hit points are reduced to zero. Additionally, you may choose to spend at least four hours in quiet repose and reflection in place of a long rest. When you finish, you get the same benefits of a long rest.
### Stop Stop, I'm Already Dead:
 - You are resistant to Necrotic damage. After a long rest or equivalent period, you may select either one damage type to be resistant to, or you may add half of your spellcasting Ability modifier to your Spell DC. This resistance or Spell DC bonus disappears after a long rest or equivalent period.
### Look Death in the Eyes:
 - A number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, you may fix your terrifying gaze on a creature within 6m of you that you can see. The target must succeed on a saving throw determined by your spellcasting Ability or be frightened for 1 minute. The DC for this ability is 10 plus your Spellcasting modifier. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich’s gaze for the next 24 hours.
